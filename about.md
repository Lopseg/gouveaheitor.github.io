## About me

My name is Heitor "D3LET" Gouvêa and I just create things I need to see exist in the world; I am currently working on projects that help people, organizations, and companies take control of their own information.

### My way here

By the end of 2014, I started studying programming independently and by the end of 2015 I was already fascinated by the world of offensive information security.

In early 2016 I participated in a Hackathon and later I was hired to work in the Brazilian government in the area of ​​Information Technology - I worked in several teams, such as: development, architecture, information security and assistance in the management of large projects. Some time after working as a Trainee, I worked as a Information Security Analyst for some Brazilian companies, and after a while I decided to start a career as an Independent Researcher so that I could concentrate on things that really made sense with my purpose.

During my work as a Independent Researcher, I worked alongside incredible companies like Shawee, Github and HackerOne and other not-so-famous but equally amazing companies. I am fascinated by the area of ​​offensive security, so I spend many hours studying in this field. I have audited high profile websites for security vulnerabilities and have managed/worked in teams of software engineers and computer scientists delivering high security architecture.

In the past i won some prizes, for example: first place in the CTF of Bsides São Paulo 16th, first place in the qualification for Hackaflag 2019 and first place in Hackathon of the city of Campinas in 2017.
